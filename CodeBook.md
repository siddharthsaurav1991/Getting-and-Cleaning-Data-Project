This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

##Initial Data
The dataset includes the following files:

* 'README.txt'

* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

* 'features.txt': List of all features.

* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

* 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

##Transformations
* First I merged the test and training dataset to create one dataset.
* Then I extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Then I used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Then I Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive activity names.
* And finally I created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final tidydata.txt file is available in the repo.
