##Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This is the project for the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" offered in the Data Science Specialisation offered by Johns Hopkins University.

###Introduction
The data used in this assignment is taken from the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset study. We are to take the dataset stored in a zip file, run a data cleaning script that creates a tidy data file and upload the tidy data to the assignment page. Also this READ ME and a Code Book (together with the processing script) are to be uploaded to a repository in our Github account and a link to that account is to be provided on the assignment page.

###Project Instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
